**About Me**
  I’m a Cybersecurity student with a broad interest in different areas of security and computer science.
  I’m particularly passionate about human factors, security awareness, and gamification in cybersecurity.

  I consider myself a determined and highly curious person who genuinely enjoys learning new things. Outside     of university, I love exploring all kinds of hobbies, especially those related to crafting, scale modelling, and of course, videogames.

📁**About This Profile**
  This is my personal GitHub account, where I upload a selection of my private and academic projects.

  It’s a new profile, created to replace my previous university account, which will be deactivated once I graduate and lose access to the institutional email. \*sob\*
  I’m currently migrating all my projects here — please excuse the work in progress! :’)
